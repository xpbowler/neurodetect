## Background

As a patient develops cancer, their gene expression pattern changes in a characteristic way that can be quantified by sequencing their RNA, yielding a numerical expression value for every gene. NeuroDetect is a convolutional neural network able to predict whether a patient’s RNA-seq data is likely to be representative of cancer tissue. This cost-effective, non-invasive diagnosis method aims to increase the success rate of early cancer detection.

## 🌿 About

The CNN was trained in Tensorflow using patient RNA-seq data transformed into 2D images suitable for the CNN’s convolutional layer. Architecture: 2.4M parameters, 98.7% accuracy, 2 convolution+MaxPooling layers followed by 2 dense fully-connected layers. The CNN is able to classify 4 types of cancer: breast, lung, kidney, and uterine cancer. 


## How to use it 

NeuroDetect takes a 2D image transformed from RNA-seq data as the input. Under ```c_images``` the test and train data can be found. Under each category, there are 8 classes of tissue: 

- Breast Normal Tissue (BRCA.N)
- Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA.T)
- Kidney Renal Normal Tissue (KIRC.N)
- Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC.T)
- Lung Normal Tissue (LUAD.N)
- Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD.T)
- Uterine Corpus Endometrial Normal Tissue (UCEC.N)
- Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC.T)
